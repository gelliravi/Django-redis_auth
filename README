Description:
This project is meant to be a template project for Django 1.3 projects.
Specifically, it includes an application called redisauth (Redis Auth).  This
will store a user's session along is his/her information in redis upon login and
will be deleted after the session expires or the user logs out.  This is meant
as a template we can use when starting projects that include having a django web
server as well as a node.js/socket.io server.  This provides the socket.io
server with a way to authenticate a user with the session.  The session can be
accessed on the client side using a library such as jquery cookie.
